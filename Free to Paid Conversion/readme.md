Objective:

The project aims to analyze the conversion funnel of students in an online learning platform, tracking their journey from registration to content engagement and eventual course purchase. Specifically, it seeks to:

1. Identify the time gap between student registration and their first engagement with course content.

2. Determine the time gap between the first engagement and the first purchase.

3. Calculate the overall conversion rate of students from free content viewers to paid customers.

4. Compute the average time taken from registration to content engagement and from engagement to purchase.




Conclusion:

1. The conversion rate from free users to paid users is derived by comparing the number of students who made a purchase against those who engaged with the content. This metric provides insight into the platformâ€™s effectiveness in encouraging purchases.
 
2. The average time between registration and first content engagement (days_diff_reg_watch) helps assess user interest and engagement patterns. A long delay may indicate a need for better onboarding strategies.

3. The average time between first content engagement and purchase (days_diff_watch_purch) reflects how quickly users decide to buy after consuming free content. A shorter duration suggests strong course appeal, while a longer duration may indicate hesitation or a need for additional marketing efforts.
 
4. The analysis can help optimize marketing strategies, such as offering personalized discounts, improving the onboarding experience, or enhancing free content to increase conversions.
